# YaleFaces-and-MusicGenres
Two applications of the SVD are discussed herein. The first is using the SVD to perform an analysis of images of faces and their major components, and how the components are more important for different faces. The second is using the SVD to deconstruct some different genres of music into their major components, and attempting to use those components to attempt to classify new samples of music. Part 2 uses three genres, Rap, Piano, and R&B.
